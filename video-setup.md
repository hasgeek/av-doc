## Setting up video

There are 3 main feeds we need to capture:

1. Speaker’s slides
2. Audience camera
3. Speaker feed

Speaker feed (Face) and the audience camera will never have to appear on the projection, and hence will directly feed to the computer with capture cards. The speaker’s slides on the other hand will have to be copied twice for the projection + TelePrompTer.

To do this, we use a HDMI splitter or a switch. A switch allows you to mix outputs and inputs and change them on the fly, whereas a splitter will simply split the signal into two/three copies.

The slides are split first to provide a copy to the projection, one copy as the recording and one to the TelePrompTer.
