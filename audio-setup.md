**Setting the Audio**:

Connect an audio source to the computer and in settings > audio, set the audio source to the device you connected. Turn off any other options and set the audio preview to the speaker/headphones you’re using.

Next, in the presentation screen, you’ll see the audio indicator. Adjust the output from the audio source till the small thin orange bar below the indicator reaches the max level. Adjust till only when the audio peaks, the level hits the edge. What you hear over the headphones is also dependent on the headphone output volume you’ve set. Keep this at 50% or 75% when testing to hear like how a person would be hearing the audio.

**Eliminating noise:**

1) Noise is most likely due to poor grounding in the electrical supply. Make sure that any source of power is coming from a single point, such as the UPS point at the venue.

2) It can also be due to rouge audio sources such as the cameras used. This can be fixed in the video source settings and setting the audio to none. Do not refresh after doing this, since refresh will reset the settings.

3) Noise can also be due to bad cables. To eliminate this, try unplugging and listening for the noise. When you’ve isolated the source, swap cables to check the problem. Make sure that you’re using similar types of cables, XLR-XLR. The 1/4” cables are not balanced and will have more noise than XLR.

4)Also check with headphones through a mixer and the audio interface as well.

**Setting up the microphones**

The current model of mics we use at events is GTD Audio. There are two types of mic kits we have:

1) 2 collar + 2 hand mics
2) 4 hand mics

Each kit comes with a 4x1 mic receiver which talks to 4 mics and gives output from them. Each microphone has to be paired with a receiver. The configuration is done with groups and channels. Groups and channels can be thought of different spectra in the signals. Each group is divided into multiple channels.

To correctly configure the mics with the receivers, turn on the receiver first and all the microphones. Don’t connect any output yet.

1. Check that all the mics have pairings with a receiver.
2. No two mics should have the same combination of group + channel.
3. Avoid channels being too close to each other. For instance, start with Group 1 Channel 3, Group 1 Channel 6, Group 1 Channel 9 etc.
4. If two mics have the same configuration, you can end up with overlap of the audio signals. We've had a case were audio from one auditorium would feed into the other due to misconfigured microphones.
5. Pair the microphones in order as it’s continent for the operator.
6. All microphone usage is not similar. Speaker mics will need much more control over volume, mute etc and will have to have separate controls.
7. Audience microphones on the other hand are used only for a fraction of the duration of the speaker microphones and hence can have coarse controls.
8. Each receiver can output individual mics over XLR or one receiver can mix and send all four channels through one out, 1/4” jacks.

Once the configuration is done, remember to replace the batteries with fresh ones. Swap batteries when they’re down to 30% capacity. Do not wait for the charge to run out completely.
