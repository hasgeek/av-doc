# Guidelines for presentations at HasGeek Conferences

## Structure:
- The presentation needs to have a broad structure defining:
			- The problem
			- Use cases studied
			- Solutions presented, alternatives and conclusion
- All sections will need an introduction slide which has no other text other than the title of the section
- Each section should have subtopics which span across 1-3 slides per topic.
- Each slide should have the appropriate heading with the same font size, font style and position on the slide.
- The body text should preferably be 20-24

## Must have slides:
- Title slide with Name, Designation/Job Title, Company, Title of the talk, contact information (email, twitter) etc.
- State the problem you're trying to solve or a summary slide, to give an idea of what you would be covering
- Concluding slide, project links and references
- Will you be taking questions? Clarify what questions you will be taking up.

## Format:
- You will be presenting from your own laptop, unless informed in advance.
- Use offline formats such as Apple keynote or Microsoft Powerpoint where possible. Upload to Google slides as a backup, but do not rely on an online presentation, which would require Wi-Fi
- Avoid saving the presentation as a PDF. PDF is not a format optimized for a presentation and will cause issues with page turns and alignment.

## Aspect ratio:
- Screens will be widescreen with an aspect ratio of 16:9
- DO NOT use 4:3 unless explicitly told to do so. You will have to change the aspect ratio before presenting in this case, and the layout of the presentation will be destroyed if you make this change towards the very end.

## Typography
- Use a maximum of 2-3 typefaces in your presentation. Avoid pairing fonts unless you know how to. Instead stick to a single font and bring about variation using different font weights and styles in the same font family.
- Avoid long sentences in your presentation. A line should be a maximum of 50-60 characters to keep things readable.
- Provide plenty of white space around you content to ensure there is enough space to focus the reader's attention.
- Ensure enough contrast between ‘Headings’ and ‘Body’ text in terms of size, font weight and font style.
- Use font sizes between 18-24 for the body text in your slides.
- A line spacing of 1.4x-1.8x the font size is adequate for good readability.
- Align all elements in your slides to fall on a grid. Left aligning your elements works best in most cases.
- Provide adequate page margins on the slide and stay consistent to this across the presentation.
- Avoid using fonts which are not installed by default in common operating systems or web services. In case we quickly need to debug your presentation or switch over to a different machine, you might have weird changes in your slides.
- If you have to use custom fonts, make sure to embed the font in your presentation. In most software and services, you can do this when saving. File > Options > Save (check embed fonts box)

## Colors
- Provide adequate contrast between background and foreground elements.
- Try to account for color blindness among attendees and other constraints. The fewer colors you use, the fewer instances of confusion. This is a good guide on picking colors for your presentation to accommodate everyone:http://colorsafe.co. It also checks if the fonts and backgrounds have adequate contrast.

### Do's and Dont's:
- The acceptable combinations for background and foreground are:
	- Dark background ( dark blue, navy or dark purple )
			- Light text and graphics ( white, yellow )
			- Accent colors ( Red, green, orange, light blue )
	- Light background (white, off white or a light color)
			- Dark text and graphics (dark blue, black, dark purple)
			- Accent colors ( Dark green, dark red)

- Color palettes should be used to design the presentation. It should stay consistent across sections.
- Extreme contrast is avoidable since we have a super bright LED wall. White text on balck background is at a contrast of 21:1. Sticking to 4.5:1 for headings and 7:1 for body text should be adequate to ensure readability.
- Don't let the design and the layout of your slides distract from the content. Content is king for the presentations at conferences.
- Accent colours used to highlight various elements in your presentation will also need to be consistent.
- When using photographs as background, ensure there is adequate contrast to read any content that is placed on it. Using an overlay filter or adjusting the hue of the image will help to achieve good readability.
- Use colors and symbols to represent common messages and prompts.

## Text and word rules
- Keep content in slide such that you stay on a slide for not more than 3-5 mins. Stagnant slides lose the attention of the audience.
- Use slides as cues or guidelines for what you're speaking. If you're referring to something, have a diagram or an example on screen.
- DO NOT read from your slides. They are not a script for your talk.
- Use as little text as possible to convey your message. Too much text or information can be very distracting.

## Diagrams and flowcharts
 - Diagrams and flowcharts should be large and cover the entire page. If the elements are too small, break up the graphic into 2-3 parts and spread them out in a sequence
 - Use thick, weighted lines to show flows and connections.

## Media:
 - Usage of videos, audio recordings and screencasts are okay to include. Save a backup copy of all these media in a separate folder as a contingency.
 - Inform AV team before your talk about the media you have in your slides
 - If you're using media, make sure to embed the media in your presentation instead of linking them. If linking, ensure they're saved on the local disk and not on a remote server or external location.
- In most presentation software, run the "Optimize media compatibility and media size and performance tools". Do this by heading to File > Info. This is to ensure your videos and other media run smoothly and are embedded. If you're unsure if this worked, zip a folder with the presentation and all required media.

## Privacy and content:
- Slides will be available online immediately after your talk and as recorded in the video.
- Do not include any personally identifiable information such as your person email address (unless you conduct business out of this account), customer information, addresses etc.
- Avoid using production data and metrics on your presentation unless you have a go-ahead from your organization. Anonymize customers and their data, and generate metrics to show the idea you're trying to show.

**Important: Add a license to your presentation so others don’t steal your work. It is also important to be cognizant of using copyrighted work in your presentation without proper attribution.**
